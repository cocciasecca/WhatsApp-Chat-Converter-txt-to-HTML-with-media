## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Instructions
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the cloned directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cocciasecca/WhatsApp-Chat-Converter-txt-to-HTML-with-media.git
    cd WhatsApp-Chat-Converter-txt-to-HTML
    ```
2. Move the chat text file into the same folder as the script and make sure it's named `chat.txt` or `_chat.txt`.
3. Download the WhatsApp background image from the following URL: [WhatsApp Background Image](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/97/c0/07/97c00759d90d786d9b6096d274ad3e07.png).
4. Place the downloaded image in the same folder as the script and rename it as `wallpaper.png`.
5. Move all the media files referenced in the chat into a folder named `media` in the same folder as the script. You can do this manually or using the `media_mover` script (which will automatically create a `media` folder).
    ```bash
    python3 media_mover.py
    ```
6. Execute the script by running the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    python3 whatsapp_txt_to_html.py
    ```
